dma_name            string          nullable        - stores the full text name of the Designated Market Area (DMA) 
dma_id              integer         nullable        - 3 digit numerical ID used to identify a DMA
term                string          nullable        - the human readable identifier for a term, i.e. “Acme Inc”    
week                date            nullable        - first day of the week for the current row’s position in the time series 
                                                      for combination of term, DMA, and score    
score               integer         nullable        - index from 0-100 that denotes how popular this term was for a DMA during the current date, 
                                                      relative to the other dates in the same time series for this term (260 weeks = 52 weeks * 5 years)  
rank                integer         nullable        - numeric representation of where the term falls in comparison to the other top terms 
                                                      for the day across the US market (e.g. rank of 1-25). 
                                                      Note: the rank value shows the same across all historical data and DMA   
refresh_date        date            nullable        - date when the new set of term, score, and DMA combination was added. 
                                                      Note, this column also serves as the partition key
