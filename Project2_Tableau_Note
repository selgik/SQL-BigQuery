TABLEAU NOTE: TRACK ISSUES AND SOLUTION

1. Situation
  Example: 
  - I have supermarket sales over time chart. I want to analyze top 10 sales products out of 200. 
  - Instead of having 10 charts under each per product category, I want to use filter so that I can see one sales chart each time.
  
2. Problem
  I try to use Top N item as filter, but filter card shows me the whole list of products.
  - Problem A. I cannot use Top N filter, as filter card will show the whole list of items. 
  - Problem B. I cannot use grouped list for filter. 
  - Problem C. Creating custom list takes time as I need to search and add manaully.

3. Solution
  Use parameter and apply [parameter] = [dimension] in filter.
  - Step 1. Group Top 10 products vs rest products. This will speed up Step 2.
  - Step 2. Create parameter using string and adding values from Step 1's Group. 
  - Step 3. Add products dimension as filter and go to condition > by formula > [parameter] = [products]
  - Step 4. Show parameter control panel. 
  
4. Tip
  When I used parameter control, one of sales chart showed blank result.
  - Reason: I used copied worksheet where one of product name was alised. 
  - Solution: I edited Group from 3-Step 1 by removing inner-group of product name.
