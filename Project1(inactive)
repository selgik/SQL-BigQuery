I. OVERVIEW
- Dataset: google_trends
- Link: https://console.cloud.google.com/marketplace/product/bigquery-public-datasets/google-search-trends?project=capable-blend-330013
- Description: This dataset includes the Top 25 stories and Top 25 Rising queries from Google Trends. 
  It will be made available as two separate BigQuery tables, with a set of new top terms appended daily. 
  Each set of Top 25 and Top 25 rising expires after 30 days, and will be accompanied by a rolling
  five-year window of historical data in 210 distinct locations in the United States.

dma_id              integer         nullable        - 3 digit numerical ID used to identify a DMA

III. CODES

-- PART 1: UNDERSTAND DATA
-- Question 1: What is the top keywords in Google Trends and its percentage within dataset?
-- Finding: percentage is not significant (very small). There will be no need to make % chart when visualiziaing data.

WITH cte AS (
    SELECT 
      term, 
      COUNT(term) as count_term,
      (SELECT COUNT(term) FROM bigquery-public-data.google_trends.top_terms) AS count_total
    FROM 
      bigquery-public-data.google_trends.top_terms
    GROUP BY
      term 
    ORDER BY
      count_term desc
    )  

SELECT 
    term, 
    count_term, 
    count_total,
    ROUND (count_term/count_total*100, 2) AS percentage_pie
FROM 
    cte


-- Question 2: How should I understand score? What are the recent hot keywords?
-- (1) Check the top keywords first

SELECT *
FROM bigquery-public-data.google_trends.top_terms
WHERE week = "2021-11-21" 
ORDER BY score DESC 

-- (2) check the lowest score for the keyword

SELECT *
FROM bigquery-public-data.google_trends.top_terms
WHERE week = "2021-11-21" -- found there are NULL values
      and score IS NOT NULL
ORDER BY score ASC


-- Question 3: What is the measured time frame?
-- Finding: first week is 2016-10-30 and the last week is 2021-11-21
-- (1) top_terms table

SELECT max(week), min(week)
FROM bigquery-public-data.google_trends.top_terms

-- (2) top_rising_terms table

SELECT max(week), min(week)
FROM bigquery-public-data.google_trends.top_rising_terms


-- Questsion 4: What is the difference between terms and rising terms? Compare the results.
-- Finding: Some keywords tend to appear in both tables. 
-- (1) top_terms table

SELECT *
FROM bigquery-public-data.google_trends.top_terms
WHERE week = "2021-11-21" AND dma_name = "Columbus OH"
ORDER BY score DESC,  term ASC 
LIMIT 100

-- (2) top_rising_terms table
SELECT *
FROM bigquery-public-data.google_trends.top_rising_terms
WHERE week = "2021-11-21" AND dma_name = "Columbus OH"
ORDER BY score DESC, term ASC
LIMIT 100


-- Question 5: What are the top keyword appearing in both top_terms and top_rising_terms?
-- Finding: only 1 result. "49ers" with counts 54,600. But why? I noticed few keywords appearing in both tables in Q4? Maybe BigQuery is case senstive?

SELECT terms.term, COUNT(terms.term) AS counts
FROM bigquery-public-data.google_trends.top_terms AS terms
JOIN 
    (SELECT term, COUNT(term) 
    FROM bigquery-public-data.google_trends.top_rising_terms 
    GROUP BY term 
    ORDER BY COUNT(term) desc) AS rterms
ON terms.term = rterms.term
GROUP BY terms.term
ORDER BY counts DESC 


-- Qeustion 6: Re-run the query by ignoring case sensitivity 
-- Finding: term column on top_terms table has capital letters. I used LOWER function to match column. Now 94 results appear with top keyword "Kyle Rittenhouse" with counts 383,460.

SELECT terms.term, COUNT(terms.term) as counts 
FROM bigquery-public-data.google_trends.top_terms AS terms
JOIN 
    (SELECT term, COUNT(term) 
    FROM bigquery-public-data.google_trends.top_rising_terms 
    GROUP BY term 
    ORDER BY count(term) desc) AS rterms
ON lower(terms.term) = rterms.term
GROUP BY terms.term
ORDER BY counts DESC 



-- PART2: VERIFY DATA (COMPARE DATA IN TABLEAU VS BIGQUERY)
-- Question 7: In Tableau, I inner joint top_terms with top_rising_terms. I got top keyword as "Kyle Rittenhouse" with counts# 1,526,280. WHY?
-- Finding: Results from BigQuery on below queries are 383,460 | 218,820 | 602,280
-- Follow up: In Tableau, I union-ed instead of join. Then I got top keyword as "Kyle Rittenhouse" with counts# 602,280.

WITH cte AS (
    SELECT 
        term, 
        count(term) AS counts1,
        (SELECT COUNT(term) FROM bigquery-public-data.google_trends.top_rising_terms WHERE term = "kyle rittenhouse") AS counts2
    FROM 
        bigquery-public-data.google_trends.top_terms
    WHERE term = "Kyle Rittenhouse"
    GROUP BY term)

SELECT counts1, counts2, counts1+counts2
FROM cte

-- Question 8: Why does "Kyle Rittenhouse" keyword appear in week of 2016? What am I missing?
-- Finding: Still pending. According to research, incidence of "Kyle Rittenhouse" happend in 2020. It looks like I am misunderstanding the 'week' column.
-- PROJECT ON HOLD.
